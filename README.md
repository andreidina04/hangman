💀 Hangman Game
This is a classic command-line implementation of the Hangman game built with Python.

🚀 How to Play
Run the script: Execute the Python file (your_script_name.py) in your terminal.

Guess a letter: The game will display a series of underscores representing the secret word. Enter one letter at a time when prompted.

Reveal the word: If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in the word.

Lose a life: If your guess is incorrect, you lose one life, and the Hangman figure will progress.

Win or Lose: The game ends when you either correctly guess all the letters in the word (you win) or run out of lives (you lose).

✨ Features
Classic Gameplay: A faithful reproduction of the traditional Hangman experience.

ASCII Art: Visual representation of the Hangman figure for each life lost.

Live Tracking: Shows your remaining lives and the letters you have already used.
